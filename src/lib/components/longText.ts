a freelance Full Stack Developer & First Year Computer Science Student.
I'm well versed in frameworks like Sveltekit, Nextjs + I can 3d model whatever my macbook can handle.

Outside of coding, I'm deeply into design, illustration, and animationâ€”anything that lets me flex my creative muscles.
I believe the intersection of technology and creativity is where the most exciting innovations happen, and I'm always eager to explore that space.`;
